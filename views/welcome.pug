            h2 What is Machine Learning?
            p
                | Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data.
                | Instead of being explicitly programmed to perform a task, machine learning models are trained on large datasets to recognize patterns and make predictions.
                | This approach allows for the development of highly adaptable and accurate systems that can improve over time as they are exposed to more data.

            p
                | In the context of object detection, machine learning models are trained to identify and locate objects within images or video streams.
                | These models use complex algorithms and neural networks to analyze visual data and make predictions about the presence and location of various objects.

        .coco-ssd
            h2 What is the COCO-SSD Model?
            p
                | The COCO-SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) model is a pre-trained object detection model that can identify and locate objects in images and video streams.
                | It is trained on the COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset, which contains over 80 different object categories, including everyday items like people, cars, and animals.

            p
                | The SSD architecture allows the model to make predictions in a single pass through the network, making it highly efficient and suitable for real-time applications.
                | The model generates bounding boxes around detected objects and assigns a confidence score to each prediction, indicating the likelihood that the object is correctly identified.

        .how-it-works
            h2 How Does Object Detection Work?
            p
                | Object detection involves identifying and locating objects within an image or video stream.
                | The COCO-SSD model uses a single deep neural network to predict the bounding boxes and class probabilities for each object in the image.
                | This process involves several steps, including feature extraction, bounding box regression, and non-maximum suppression to filter out overlapping boxes.

            p
                | Feature extraction is the process of identifying important visual features within an image, such as edges, textures, and shapes.
                | The neural network uses these features to make predictions about the presence and location of objects.
                | Bounding box regression involves refining the coordinates of the predicted boxes to more accurately match the objects' locations.
                | Non-maximum suppression is used to eliminate redundant boxes and keep only the most confident predictions.

        .detect-page
            h2 Using the Detect Page
            p
                | On the /detect page, you can select objects from a predefined list and start the detection process.
                | The model will analyze the video stream from your webcam and highlight the detected objects in real-time.
                | This feature allows you to quickly and easily test the capabilities of the COCO-SSD model and see it in action.

        .real-time-detect-page
            h2 Using the Real-Time Detect Page
            p
                | The /realTimeDetect page allows you to perform real-time object detection with additional logging capabilities.
                | You can start a detection session, and the detected objects will be logged for further analysis.
                | This feature is particularly useful for applications that require continuous monitoring and logging of detected objects, such as security systems or data collection for research purposes.
